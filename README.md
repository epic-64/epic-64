PHP professional since 2013, Laravel since 2018.
Proudly sponsoring PHPStan, for protecting my last remaining braincells from dealing with any untyped code ever again.

Working on a cloud telephone system and a finance processing application has inspired me to look into immutability
and functional programming. I regret that I was not informed about a lot of these concepts and languages that support them earlier.

On the other hand, I am coping with the immense drop in tooling quality in other languages.
PHP really is an absolute beast when it comes to tooling, that about evens out its 20+ years of lag in language design.

Side projects:
- ascii game in Scala 3 and Java Lanterna
- fullstack website in Scala 3, Akka Http, Twirl, htmx (frontend stack isn't set in stone yet)
- 2d game in Rust using Macroquad
