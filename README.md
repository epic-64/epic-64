## Hi there âœ¨â€‹ðŸ‘¾â€‹

I'm William, a 90s kid from the Federal Republic of Germany. I only got internet access when I was 15 years old. Before that, I literally went to internet cafÃ©s every time I wanted to download funny internet pictures or play an online game.

Currently working on an ascii game in Scala:

I studied Cognitive Science in 2011. Due to multiple forms of existential and actual crisis kickin in when I was 20 years old I had to abandon it, but I still think it's the *sickest* subject of study out there. If I had the urge to complete formal studies, I'd pick it again.
But instead, these days I choose to simply reap the rewards of other cognitive scientists, bringing us those sweet sweet LLMs.

My two main hobbies are **gaming** and **learning programming languages**.

## Favorite language:
**Scala**: My current language of choice. Only got some weeks of experience with it, but I'm already writing code pretty confidently. It's crazy that I can import Java packages and just straight up use them. The short syntax is godlike. You can take a Java or PHP program, write it in Scala and get rid of 60% of lines of code while **increasing** readability. The type system is pure bliss and if you feel cheeky you can omit type declarations - the compiler infers them for you. Btw, my third hobby is: **refactoring**. And Scala is perfect for that. Because it supports thirty gazillion ways of writing code it is basically guaranteed you can port your program into Scala in a way you already know how to write, make it work, then start refactoring it into something shorter, more robust, more expressive, more idiomatic. Because of its short syntax and flexibility it is also extremely easy to work with for LLMs, and I'd argue even better for it than Python, because of the added type-safety. Often you'll just type out your function signature and Co-Pilot knows **exactly** what you're trying to do, and ChatGPT (or other Scala devs) can tell with pretty high confidence what your problem is.

## Programming languages (comment length reflects my proficiency in them):
- **PHP**: Been using it professionally since 2014. I do respect the language for some recent features (alright type system with explicitly nullable types and union types; traits for multi inheritance, basic enums, match construct, arrow functions), but in the last six years I have realized how underdeveloped and unproductive it is, when tasked with serious work, especially when working with people who do not see any issues with the language (aka most PHP devs). It does not help that the community is actively preventing modern (if you count stuff that has been in Java since 2004 as modern) features from being added, most annoyingly, Generics https://wiki.php.net/rfc/generics.
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS, Jquery, Web Components - back to vanilla JS. Been using it for over 10 years and still never learned how to do it correctly. See my recent attempt at implementing NES Tetris https://github.com/epic-64/nestris. I do not like this language - but unfortunately I do like something that runs on everyone's and their aunt's device. Btw: Javascript Stored Procedures for MySQL dropped. What kinda joke timeline is this? https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/9.0/en/stored-routines-js.html
- **TypeScript**: Used it for half a year at a workplace. Has a **super based type system**. Since it compiles to JS it basically is the easiest thing to deploy in the entire world. Good language. Professionally it would take me a few years to get on the same level as I am in PHP (with frameworks, best practices and all that), and I'd rather learn an *even better language* (Scala, Kotlin, F#, Rust are the ones that come to my mind)
- **MySQL**: What can I say? All my homies use MySQL. Language would be 10x better if SELECT was the last part of an expression rather than the first.
- **Bash**: I find myself writing more and more bash scripts as I get older, usually to create aliases on steroids
- **HTML**: In 2007 I did a two week internship in a HTML shop. They were using Dreamweaver. The one-room office was stacked with paperwork, old pizza boxes and empty cups of coffee. I thought these guys were absolute hackers. And I hated it - remember - at that age I didn't have internet and all I ever used a computer for was gaming, but now I had to deal with writing functional instructions, and it was hard. Everyone who says HTML is not a programming language is first of all wrong (it is a DSL, feeding into some interpreter written by someone way smarter than you, to translate your (literal) text file into machine instructions - like 99.999% of all "real programmer code" out there), but also fail to see how it activates all the same neurons you need for thinking and expressing yourself in a structured, nested and absolutely coherent way - something that is not natural at all.

## Languages that I used seriously at some point, and my condensed thoughts about them:
- **Java**: Scanner scanner = new Scanner();
- **Lua**: Least refactorable language just dropped
- **Groovy**: Wait, why isn't THIS called JavaScript?
- **Ruby**: Instead of `foo = "foo"`, you can just do `:foo`. Why don't other languages have this?

## Languages that I refuse to learn:
- **Python**: "Want something that's less type safe than PHP and slower than JavaScript? Hold my comedy script"
- **C**: I can't be arsed to deal with multi-byte characters manually

## Languages I tried (for a week or so) and was impressed with:
- **Rust**: Too many skill issues on my end. Tempted to learn it whenever I see how much memory and CPU cycles my garbage collector hogs.
- **Haskell**: Changed something in my brain and made me attracted to functional programming.
- **Prolog**: It's really an engine that you can just feed your problem into and it will solve it for you. Pretty based and I'm trying to find a reason to get back into it (after using it like once in uni). Requires good problem describing skills.
