PHP professional since 2013, Laravel since 2018.
Proudly sponsoring PHPStan, for protecting my last remaining braincells from dealing with any untyped code ever again.

Working on a cloud telephone system and a finance processing application has inspired me to look into immutability, compile time type safety
and functional programming. I regret that I haven't dived earlier into these concepts, and languages that support them.

On the other hand, I am coping with the immense drop in tooling quality in other languages.
PHP really is an absolute beast when it comes to tooling, that about evens out its 20+ years of lag in language design.

Side projects:
- Runescape-esque ascii game in Scala 3 and Java Lanterna (terminal based)
- fullstack website in Scala 3, Akka Http, Twirl, htmx, vanilla CSS (frontend stack isn't set in stone yet)
- 2d game in Rust using Macroquad (not sure yet about the genre, I'm just figuring out how to draw rectangles and handling inputs)
