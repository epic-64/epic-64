I beat the weak typing out of PHP and especially Laravel projects.
Proudly sponsoring PHPStan for protecting my last remaining brain cellsm from further assaults.

All things considered PHP 8 is a 6/10 language, but only if you know what you're doing (i.e. you know what a 10/10 language looks like).
At that point however, why would you stick with PHP? Ergo, when working with PHP enthusiasts I have to accept it being used like a 4/10 language,
which makes me want to quit it even more. I have around 12000 hours of professional experience (with a few more thousands in side projects) with this garbage so please don't try to lecture me.

I am building tools and a website in Scala 3 until I'm good enough to do it professionally.

Also writing a game in Rust.
